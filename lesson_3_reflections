Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

 - Forks are used on the github platform to clone another repository
 - Cloning can be achieved  by getting a repository on github and cloning it to a person local computer
   or a person clones a repository into another location locally on a computer.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

 - Making changes in a seperate branch gives others the oppurtunity for others to work or edit the branches.
